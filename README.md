### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Caleb.

I'm a Frontend Developer and writer, I literally just build cool stuffs by implementing/transforming user interface designs to apps that are functional on the web. 

Cheers! :cocktail:

I make use of [ReactJS](https://reactjs.com) to translate user interfaces that are aesthetic and accessible for people. No, scratch that. I make use of Next.js, the React framework that is used for building production ready apps.

You'll find me on the internet saying stuffs about Next.js sometimes. When I mean "saying stuffs" I'm creating technical articles around Next.js and React in general.

Just getting familiar with the opensource software community. edit: I've gotten familiar with contributing to OSS on github.

PS: **I and JavaScript are sworn enemies** :grin:
