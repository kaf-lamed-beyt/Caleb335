### Hi there 👋 I'm Caleb.

I'm a Frontend Developer and writer. I try as much as possible to create User interfaces that are aesthetic, accessible and iclusive for people. I'm also open to different ideas from people, and i'd love to contribute to open-source someday.

Cheers! :smile: :cocktail:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning [ReactJS](httsp://reactjs.com) and how to make software accessible to people
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that'd expose me to the world of open source software
- 💬 Ask me about CSS animations and transitions.
PS:- I'm not a guru, but i'd try as much as possible to assist you.
